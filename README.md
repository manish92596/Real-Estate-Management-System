</br>

## Functionality of Agent

The agent can view their own details, such as how many properties they are currently holding and which properties have been sold or are still available. If any buyer contacts the agent to purchase a property, the agent confirms the availability of the property and proceeds with the sale. Negotiations may occur for the price, and once the terms are agreed upon, the agent enters the date when this property was sold. After entering the date, a transaction ID is generated.

## Functionality of Buyer

Here, the buyer can see their own details and also view how many properties they have purchased.
